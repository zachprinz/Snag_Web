<h2>Snag</h2>
	<ul>

	<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
	You control a circle, use the space bar to snag on to nearby hooks and throw yourself around your world.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	I want the player to have a relaxing experience and enjoy playing around with the physics of the game.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
	This game would fit in the arcade genre similar to games like Super Hexagon, or The Impossible Game.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Game Play:</strong>
	The user can use the space bar to at first snag onto nearby hooks and then release from them.
	This can be done repeatedly to launch the users avatar around 3 central hooks. In the future it may be interesting to allow
	user to climb upward to score points using this mechanic. Allowing your ball avatar to come into contact with the ground
	or one of the walls will result in the game restarting you and your score being reset.
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Setting/Story:</strong>
	The game is abstract, it is what the players make of it.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
	This prototype is/was originally intended to evaluate the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum in games.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	The target audience for this game is casual gamers who are easily entertained.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
	Not long.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	It is important to accurately assess the space between your ball avatar and the nearest hook.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Assets:</strong>
	All assets, audio, sprites, and otherwise were created from scratch.
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
	Should be able to implement/polish anything sudgested here (or within reason) within reason in 10-40 hours.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Closest Phaser Example:</strong>
	None, I haven't looked at any phaser examples.
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Capabilities:</strong>
		Simple Art (as in shapes and color themes) However I think my art style ends up looking fairly proffesional.
		Programing (I would like to think I'm pretty good at this.)
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Lacking:</strong>
		Complex Art
		Sound Design
		I really don't like polishing things, I kind of get bored once the fun stuff is done.
	</li>
